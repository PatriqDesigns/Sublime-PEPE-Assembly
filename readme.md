Some more info
------------------
* I'm not an expert on regex so my syntax definition may not be the best, nor have the best practices, but it works. Maybe in the future I will take the time to learn more regex and improve it.
* This is a syntax definition for assembly that works on a processor called PEPE which was designed by my [_Introduction to Computer Architecture_](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/IAC317/2015-2016/1-semestre) [teacher](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/homepage/ist11899). Thus you should only use it if you are actually developing for it.
* I made this because I needed something like it when I was having my [ _Introduction to Computer Architecture_](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/IAC317/2015-2016/1-semestre) class, so I decided to help the ones who are going to have it next year by making a syntax definition for them.
